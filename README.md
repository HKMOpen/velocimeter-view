I am using this speedometer as an android UI so as to demo wss API for vss.


Steps:

1.Clone the repo

2.Build APK using 'gradlew assemble'

3.Install APK on an Android phone with network connection

4.Launch app, and app will talk to the server in Demo 1 and update the speedometers on screen.

5.Speedometer 1 shows Km/H and Speedometer 2 shows mph.
